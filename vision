2. Verify Access Rights
Ensure you have read/write permissions to the repository.
For private repositories:
Confirm that your GitHub account is a collaborator or that your access token/SSH key has the right permissions.
3. Authenticate Properly
a) For HTTPS
If using HTTPS, GitHub requires a personal access token instead of a password:

Generate a token:
Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens.
Generate a token with the required scopes (repo for full access to repositories).
Use the token instead of your password during authentication.
b) For SSH
If using SSH, ensure:

Your public SSH key is added to your GitHub account:
Generate a key if you don’t have one:
bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
Add the key to your GitHub account by copying it:
bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Go to GitHub: Settings > SSH and GPG Keys and add the key.
Test your SSH connection:
bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a success message like Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated.
4. Verify the Repository Exists
Ensure the repository exists under the specified account or organization.
Double-check for typos in the repository name or owner name.
To check a repository’s existence:

Go to the repository URL in your browser: https://github.com/username/repository.
5. Debug Further
a) Check Branch Name
Ensure you’re working on the correct branch. Modern repositories default to main instead of master.

b) Verbose Mode
Use verbose mode to gather more details about the error:

bash
Copy code
GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git pull

The error "fatal: The current branch hp has no upstream branch" means that your branch hp is not linked to a remote branch on GitHub (or any other remote). To resolve this and push your changes, follow these steps:

Solution: Push and Set the Upstream Branch
Run the following command to push the branch and set it to track the remote branch:

bash
Copy code
git push --set-upstream origin hp
This command does two things:

Pushes the hp branch to the remote repository (if it doesn’t already exist, it will create one).
Links the local hp branch to the remote hp branch, so future git pull or git push commands will work seamlessly.
Alternative Explanation
--set-upstream: This flag sets the upstream branch (remote tracking branch).
origin: Refers to the default name of the remote repository. Replace it with your remote name if it's different.
hp: Your branch name. Replace it with your actual branch name if different.
Future Workflow
Once the upstream is set, you can use simpler commands for subsequent pushes and pulls:

bash
Copy code
git push  # Push changes to the remote
git pull  # Pull changes from the remote

When you see the status "modified: HP (new commits, modified content, untracked content)", it indicates that the branch or folder HP has the following:

New commits: Changes have been committed locally but not yet pushed to the remote repository.
Modified content: Some tracked files in the HP branch/folder have been changed but not yet committed.
Untracked content: There are new files or directories not added to Git tracking yet.
Here’s how you can handle this step by step:
