 Push Your Changes
Once the remote repository is configured, you can push your changes. To do this for the first time (if your branch doesn't yet track a remote branch), use the -u flag:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin <branch-name>
Replace <branch-name> with the name of the branch you're working on, for example main or new-branch.

4. Push Without -u Flag in the Future
After setting the upstream branch with the -u flag, you can simply use:

bash
Copy code
git push
for future pushes, as Git will know where to push your changes.

Example Workflow
Add remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
Verify remote:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
Push changes to the remote repository (and set the upstream branch):

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin new-branch
After these steps, your local branch should be connected to the remote, and future git push commands will work without needing additional configuration.
